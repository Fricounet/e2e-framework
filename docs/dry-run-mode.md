# Dry Run Mode

As your test suites get bigger and more complicated over time, it is essential that the tools used for creating tests provide an easy way to identify and list the tests being processed as part of your framework when invoked with certain arguments.
This listing needs to be quick and clean to enable a quick turnaround time for test development. This requirement brings in the need to introduce a `dry-run` behavior into the `e2e-framework`.

## Unit Of Test

Go treats each function starting with `Testxxx` as the Test unit. However, the same is not entirely true in the case of the `e2e-framework`. This introduces dynamic tests that are generated during runtime programmatically for each assessment of each feature.

From the perspective of the `e2e-framework`, the Unit of test is an `Assessment` that actually performs the assertion of an expected behavior or state of the system. These assessments are run as a sub-test of the main test identified by the function `Testxxx`. All framework-specific behaviors built around this fundamental test unit of `Assessment`.

## Why not use `test.list` from `go test`?

The `test.list` is a great way to run the dry-run equivalent behavior. However, it is not easily extendable into the core of `e2e-framework` as there are framework-specific behaviors such as `setup` and `teardown` workflows.

That, in conjunction with how the `test.list` works, it is not possible to extract information such as the `assessments` in the feature using the `test.list` mode brings the need to introduce a framework-specific `dry-run` mode that can work well with `test.list` while providing all the framework-specific benefits of how the Tests to be processed can be listed.

## `--dry-run` mode

`e2e-framework` adds a new CLI flag that can be used while invoking the test called `--dry-run`. This works in conjunction with `test.list` to provide the following behavior.

1. When the `--dry-run` mode is invoked, No Setup/Teardown workflows are processed.
2. Will display the Assessments as individual tests like they would be processed if not invoked with `--dry-run` mode.
3. Skip all pre-post actions around the Before/After Features or Before/After Tests.

When tests are invoked with `-test.list` argument, the `--dry-run` mode is automatically switched to enabled to make sure setup/teardown as well as the pre-post actions can be skipped.

## Example Output with `--dry-run`

```bash
❯ go test . -test.v -args --dry-run

        --- SKIP: TestPodBringUp/Feature_Two/Wait_for_Nginx_Deployment_2_to_be_scaled_up (0.00s)
PASS
ok      sigs.k8s.io/e2e-framework/examples/parallel_features   0.945s
```

## Example with `-test.list`

```bash
❯ go test . -test.v -test.list ".*" -args
TestPodBringUp
ok      sigs.k8s.io/e2e-framework/examples/parallel_features    0.645s
```

As you can see from the above two examples, the output of the two commands is not really the same. Using `--dry-run` gives you a more framework-specific behavior of how the tests are going to be processed in comparison to `-test.list`.
